# CALPHAD sublattice model for ordered phase 

The purpose of this code is to calculate the composition values of an ordered phase defined by the CALPHAD sublattice model by minimizing the free energy in sublattice space...

The code uses the MATLAB fmincon method to minimize the sublattice model to retrieve the alloy composition...

Two examples are included for the NiNb3 order phase from two different references.
