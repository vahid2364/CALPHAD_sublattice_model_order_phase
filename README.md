# CALPHAD sublattice model for ordered phase 

This code plots the free energy of an ordered phase that is defined by CALPHAD sublattice model by minimizing the energy in sublattice space and finding the composition values...

The code uses MATLAB fmincon to minimize the sublattice model to retive the alloy composition...

Two examples are included for NiNb3 order phase from two difference references.
