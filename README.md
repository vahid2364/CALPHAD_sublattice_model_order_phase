# CALPHAD sublattice model for ordered phase 

This code plots the free energy of an ordered phase defined by the CALPHAD sublattice model by minimizing the free energy in sublattice space and finding the composition values...

The code uses the MATLAB fmincon method to minimize the sublattice model to retrieve the alloy composition...

Two examples are included for the NiNb3 order phase from two different references.
