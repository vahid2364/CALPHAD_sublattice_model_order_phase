# CALPHAD sublattice model order phase

This code plots the free energy of a phase that is defined by CALPHAD sublattice model...

The code uses MATLAb fmincon to minimize the sublattice model to retive the alloy composition ....

Two examples are included for NiNb3 order phase from two difference references.
